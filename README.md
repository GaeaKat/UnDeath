UnDeath

My modjam sub
Ever wonder if their is life after death? Wonder no more.

This mod adds several new mobs, all of which come into effect when you die.


The Deaths
==========

Skellington:
Die by those skeletal archers and your body will start to grow thin as your corpse takes up a bow to join it

Zombie:
Die by the rotted ones, and your corpse will rise as it rots.

Slimes:
Theese things swiftly dissolve you, although they seem to like storing your head and items inside them occasionally


Compiliation
============ 

Download into a freshly installed forge setup in the mcp/src/minecraft directory
and recompile/reobfusticate as usual
Remember to copy assets folder into the zip created after reobfustication!
